# AI-Driven Preventive Health Systems

This repository represents an early-stage conceptual and research-driven project focused on building AI-based preventive health infrastructures.

## Vision
Modern healthcare systems are largely reactive, intervening after disease manifests.  
This project explores a paradigm shift toward **predictive prevention**, where AI enables proactive health management through longitudinal data analysis and early risk detection.

The goal is not to build isolated apps or devices, but to design **system-level prevention infrastructures** that integrate individuals, clinicians, and health systems through AI-driven decision support.

## Core Focus Areas
- Preventive health systems  
- Longitudinal health data modeling  
- AI-driven risk prediction  
- Personalized preventive strategies  
- Health system integration  
- Decision-support architectures  

## Conceptual Direction
This project treats AI not as a diagnostic endpoint, but as a **cognitive infrastructure layer** for prevention-oriented healthcare systems.

## Status
Early-stage conceptual and research framework.  
This repository currently contains vision documents and system-level design directions.  
Technical implementation will evolve in future development phases.
