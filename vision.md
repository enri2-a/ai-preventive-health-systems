# Project Vision

Healthcare must evolve from episodic treatment to continuous prevention.

This project explores AI-driven preventive health systems as long-term infrastructures for:
- early risk detection
- personalized prevention
- proactive health engagement
- system-level resilience

Prevention is not a feature — it is a system design principle.

AI becomes the enabling intelligence layer that transforms data into anticipatory health strategies, supporting both individuals and health systems.
